## Credits

I have rewatched my pre-recorded classes of learning mySQL, and used the activities in the UCSD (Univiersity of California San Diego) SQL folder section to help me with this project. Along with watching SQL educational videos on YouTube to help better my understanding, and reading the mySQL documentation.
